- consider using venusian for the decorators
  http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/venusian/en/latest/

- currently, given the following:
    class RootController(Controller):
      @expose
      def foo(self, request): return 'bar'
  a request to "/foo" will return "bar" (as expected). however
  "/foo/zig" does not yield a 404 as it should.

- do *extensible* request path translation, e.g.
    /foo/bar/file.ext becomes Class Root > Class Bar > method 'file_ext'
  or something like that...

- support @index(expose=True), which is equivalent to specifying
  both @index *and* @expose, ie. it makes the following method:
    @index(expose=True)
    def index(...): ...
  be accessible at both /path/ and /path/index.

- does pyramid_handlers not pollute the class namespace... how does
  it achieve that????
  the unit test from
    https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_handlers/blob/master/pyramid_handlers/tests.py
  sort of implies that:
    def test_add_handler_doesnt_mutate_expose_dict(self):
        config = self._makeOne()
        views = []
        def dummy_add_view(**kw):
            views.append(kw)
        config.add_view = dummy_add_view
        exposed = [{'name':'^action3000$'}]
        class MyView(object):
            def action(self): # pragma: no cover
                return 'response'
            action.__exposed__ = exposed
        config.add_handler('name', '/{action}', MyView)
        self.assertEqual(exposed[0], {'name':'^action3000$'}) # not mutated

- perhaps change Controller.__init__(expose) to Controller.__init__(indirect)
  which is more in tune with how the rest of the framework interprets the
  attribute.

- add an `autoexpose` attribute to @expose_defaults

- create a command-line program that detects RootControllers and displays
  their hierarchy tree...

- this doesn't work as it should:

    class Base(Controller):
      @fiddle
      def first(self, request):
        # check something...

    class Extend(Base):
      @fiddle
      def second(self, request):
        # check something else...

  currently, only the first one gets called...
  (unit test pyramid_controllers.test_dispatcher.test_fiddle_with_subclassing
  tests this but is disabled)

- implement a method name transformation logic. eg. if a request comes
  in for "such & such", then look up "such_and_such"... ok, that might
  be a bit too much, but perhaps something like 'such___such'?

- make `DescriberController.formattext_html` try to load docutils, and
  if successful, do rST formatting with that. otherwise fallback to the
  pseudo-stuff...
